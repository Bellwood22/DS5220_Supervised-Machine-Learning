# ***Supervised Machine Learning***
***Become familiar with main machine learning tasks and concepts***
  - Classification vs. regression
  - Model selection, regularization, cross-validation
  - Bias vs. variance tradeoff

Regression (linear regression, polynomial regression, logistic regression), Classification (SVM, decision trees, Na√Øve Bayes, ensembles, etc.), Deep learning (different neural network architectures) will be used and learn how to decide right model in proper moment
